# Optimal BMI for runners

## Intro

In this project we analyse data from Olympic runners and give you an estimate of the optimal BMI to enhance your running performance.

```

We looked at the data from actual Olympic athletes so you don't have to, and here's how it looked like:


```python, echo=FALSE
sns.set_theme(color_codes=True)
sns.regplot(x='Height', y='Weight', data=r_numeric[r_numeric['Sex'] == 1])
```




    <AxesSubplot:xlabel='Height', ylabel='Weight'>

```python, echo=FALSE
sns.regplot(x='Height', y='Weight', data=r_numeric[r_numeric['Sex'] == 0])
```




    <AxesSubplot:xlabel='Height', ylabel='Weight'>

But worry not, we've got you. Let's unpack this and make it useful for you.

## Findings

What we realised during our investigation is...

## Tell us about you

Now, let's see how we can make all of this useful to you. Let's start by getting to know you better.


```python, echo=FALSE
r_sprint = r_numeric.loc[r_numeric['Event'] < 500]
r_middle = r_numeric.loc[(r_numeric['Event']) > 700 & (r_numeric['Event'] < 1600)]
r_long = r_numeric.loc[r_numeric['Event'] > 4000]
```


```python, echo=FALSE
X_train, X_test, w_train, w_test = train_test_split(r_numeric[['Sex', 'Age','Height', 'Year', 'Event','Medal']], r_numeric['Weight'], random_state = 42, test_size = 0.2)
```


```python, echo=FALSE
regr = LinearRegression()

regr.fit(X_train, w_train)

w_pred = regr.predict(X_test)

r2_score(w_test, w_pred)
```


```python, echo=FALSE

```
